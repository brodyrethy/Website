<h1>Making <code>vim</code> Feel like <code>Emacs</code> (Without the Bloat)</h1>
<p><b><small>Created: 2021-02-03 | Modified: 2021-02-03</small></b></p>

<p><code>Emacs</code>: A text editor, IDE, email client, file manager - and so much more - all in one. A great - yet completely bloated - piece of software. Featureful, yet much in excess. Fast, yet carries around a 1000 pound ball and chain... You get the point.</p>

<p>I should mention, when I say that I want to make <code>vim</code> like Emacs, I don't mean that I want to make <code>vim</code> weight a thousand pounds. I mean that I want to live in <code>vim</code>, and show how you can live in <code>vim</code> like you can in <code>Emacs</code>.</p>

<p>Even though <code>Emacs</code> is great, it's far from perfect. One might even say it's the Swiss army knife of text editors/IDEs/file managers/email clients/gaming centers/operating systems... Jack of all trades, master of none... What I mean to say, is that <code>Emacs</code> is good, but much too bloated for my liking. I prefer something that's immediately fast - like <code>vim</code> - and uses sensible key bindings. I hate the <code>Emacs</code> key bindings for a hole bunch of reasons I won't get into. I will say this: Even pro-church of <code>Emacs</code> types agree with me (for the most part), that its defaults are RSI-inducing none sense, and terribly inconsistent.</p>

<p>Something I do like about <code>Emacs</code>, is that you can do mostly everything computer related inside of it. This should be possible in vim, seeing as it has its own scripting language: <code>vimscript</code>.</p>

<h2><code>shell</code> Command Equivalent</h2>
<p>
As you may already know, <code>Emacs</code> users like to stay in <code>Emacs</code>. Why? This joke explains it all:
<blockquote><i>"Emacs is an operating system with a text editor included"</i></blockquote>
Fair enough. I understand the sentiment. I'd like to stay in <code>vim</code> too. Getting back to the topic, <code>vim</code> already has a built in terminal, it's the <code>:terminal</code> command. <code>Emacs</code> users like to use the <code>Emacs</code> <code>shell</code> command, and even say that it's preferred over a traditional terminal because it's being used in <code>Emacs</code>.
</p>

<p>
Here's how you can open <code>WSL</code>, <code>PowerShell</code>, and <code>cmd</code> in Windows 10:
<ul>
<li><code>:terminal cmd</code></li>
<li><code>:terminal bash</code></li>
<li><code>:terminal powershell</code></li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2><code>dired</code> Command Equivalent</h2>
<p><code>Emacs</code> people use <code>dired</code>. <code>vim</code> has something built in that's similar to <code>dired</code> called <code>netrw</code>.</p>

<h2><code>magit</code></h2>
<p>I don't use this, but someone ported it to <code>vim</code>. <a href="https://github.com/jreybert/vimagit">Download it here</a>. I use the <code>:terminal</code> command + <code>Bash</code> instead.</p>

<h2>Use <code>:split</code>/<code>:vsplit</code></h2>
<p><code>Emacs</code> people use splits instead of multiple floating <code>Emacs</code> windows. So do I. Now use them!</p>

<h2>Emailing in <code>vim</code></h2>
<p>Well, this is sort of a hack, as it isn't really built <i>inside</i> <code>vim</code>. Either way, it can be opened in of <code>vim</code> using the <code>:terminal</code> command. Plus, it uses <code>vim</code> key bindings.</p>

<p>Opening <code>mutt</code> inside of <code>vim</code> is probably still more lightweight than the <code>Emacs</code> equivalents, but I haven't tested this theory.</p>

<h2><code>org-mode</code></h2>
<p>There's a plugin to emulate it <a href="https://github.com/jceb/vim-orgmode">here</a>. I don't use it, as I prefer to use vim-wiki for note taking/organizational stuff, but it's there if you need it.</p>
