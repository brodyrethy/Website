<h1>My i3wm-Like Setup in Windows</h1>
<p><small>Created: 2020-12-10 | Modified: 2020-12-21</small></p>

<p>I choose to run Linux at all times, except for when I can't, like when I'm studying cybersecurity (specifically during malware analysis). During those times, I choose to use Windows + My AutoHotkey Master Script + Vim/Vim-like keybindings/programs. My setup tries (and succeeds) to create an i3-like environment inside of Windows. There are three portions to the setup, being Firefox for web browser needs, AutoHotkey for defining OS wide keybindings, and gVim (graphical vim) for text editing/programming/writing. I also add a few other functionalities, such as F1-12 keys to minimize/maximize active window, switch to previous window, and to execute or switch to programs.</p><br>

<h2>AutoHotkey</h2>
<p>My master script recreates:
<ul>
<li>Programs/commands are bound to ModifierKey+KeyboardKeys, e.g. LWin+b executes firefox</li>
<li>Volume/media are bound to Modifier+F2-4 (LWin+F2 executes volume down, LWin+F3 executes volume up, etc.)</li>
<li>Alt+h/j/k/l executes ArrowKey+Up/Down/Left/Right (this ensures that I don't have to take my hands off of the keyboard or the home row for small actions, such as UAC, or dialog boxes.)</li>
<li>F1 toggles maximize</li>
<li>F2 minimizes active program</li>
<li>F4 switches to previous window</li>
<li>F6 kills active window (better than Alt+F4)</li>
<li>F11 switches goes to the browser tab to the left of the current</li>
<li>F12 switches goes to the browser tab to the right of the current</li>
<li>PauseBreak closes current browser tab</li>
</ul>
</p><br>

<h2>Firefox</h2>
<p>I make sure to download <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/vimium-ff/">Vimium</a> and disable smooth scrolling in both Vimium and the browser.</p><br>
