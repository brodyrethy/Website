			<h1>Window Managers</h1>
			<p> <font_red>NOTE:</font_red> From here on out, I will be writing tiling window manager as TWM and floating window manager as FWM.</p>

			<h2>What is a Window Manager?</h2>
			<p>First, a definition of a window manager: A window manager is simply a piece of software which controls the placement of each window.</p>

            <h2>What is a Floating Window Manager?</h2>
            <p>In a floating window manager, each window floats (of course). <i>Typically</i>, a FWM is the default type you would see on Mac OS X, Windows, and Linux (GNOME, XFCE, Openbox, etc.).</p>

			<h2>What is a Tiling Window Manager?</h2>
			<p>A tiling window manager is similar to the last definition but that it functions in a sort of grid-like style instead of a floating one, where everything is displayed on the screen at once (no minimization available here, kids). More so, each window is either considered a master, or a slave. Only one master window is allowed at a time. First, you open a window which is automatically the master. When another window is opened, the master is divided in half, where the new window becomes the master and the last becomes a slave. Then, if another is opened, the newest is the master, and the last two are slaves, and so on, so forth... TWMs almost always also have a workspace system bound to the Modifier key (Windows key, usually) + 1 - 9. Pressing WinKey+1 will bring you to workspace 1, WinKey+2 will bring you to workspace 2, and so on... This is a big part of the TWM workflow.</p>
			<h3>i3wm</h3>
            <p>
                i3wm: a <i>manual</i> TWM (you choose how new windows are split, be it vertical or horizontally, and windows can be re-sized).

            </p>

			<h3>dwm</h3>
            <p>
                dwm: a <i>dynamic</i> TWM (windows are split automatically according to a predetermined layout; Master window on the left, slave windows on the right in the "default" layout).

            </p>

<!--			<h2>Speed Differences</h2>
			<p>Switching the currently selected window a TWM is faster than in a FWM. Here are the different ways you can accomplish the task in dwm and Windows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>dwm</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Windows key + j (for down)/h (for up) to flip through the window(s)</li>
					<li>Move your directly over to it, which will autoselect it</li>
				</ul>
			</ul>
			<ul>
				<li>Windows</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Windows key + the index number of the program on the taskbar</li>
					<li>Move mouse to the taskbar and select the program from there</p></li>
					<li>Alt+Tab until you find the program</li>
					<li>If already on screen but not selected, move mouse over to the window and click it to set as selected</li>
				</ul>
			</ul>
