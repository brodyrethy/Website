            <h1>Why Gaming VPNs Are Scams</h1>
            <p><b>DO NOT FALL FOR THESE SCAMS</b></p>
            <p>These "gaming" VPNs only work if you are already being capped/toggled inside of your network. In this case, the VPN will allow you to encrypt your traffic and in turn allow you to bypass any packet blocking on your network, which would allow you to run at the fully uncapped potential of the network. Very rarely will any home networks contain any sort of packet blocking/filtering (if it does contain packet blocking/filtering you would know because you would have set it up yourself), but it's typical for company/university networks to. Even if this is the case, the speed will be totally dependent on the weakest link of the network. If you have a slow router/switch, all of your data will be bottleneck'd to the capacity of that device.</p>
            <p>TLDR: "Gaming" VPNs won't do anything on your home network. If you're being packet filtered, just buy a normal, uncapped (not gaming oriented) VPN.</p>
