<hr>

<h2>What Is moses?</h2>
<p>A tiny DDoS (Distributed Denial-of-Service) botnet utility written for research purposes. </p>

<p>
<small>You can download moses <a href="https://github.com/rethyxyz/Moses/archive/master.zip">here</a></small>
</p>

<h2>How Does moses Work?</h2>
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>moses</b> gets Windows username</li>
<li><b>moses</b> copies itself to AppData directory, Windows startup folder, and a few others</li>
<li><b>moses</b> will copy itself to all storage devices connected to the computer (A-Z) if drive exists and permissions allow for it</li>
<li><b>moses</b> is placed into an infinite While loop</li>
<ul>
<li><b>moses</b> ingests URL/tar{1,2,3}.htmll web pages as variables named web_content_{1,2,3}</li>
<li><b>moses</b> checks if the first variable (web_content_1) contains the command "DDoS"</li>
<ul>
<li>If it's found, the start_ddos_attack() function is called while taking the second variable (web_content_2) as the first argument for the destination IP address, and the second (web_content_3) for the DDoS attack end time in 24-hour time format</li>
</ul>
<li><b>moses</b> sleeps for six seconds</li>
<li>The loop starts again</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Operation</h2>
<p>Each <b>moses</b> instance is operated globally through the <b>remote_control</b> files (bash and Python versions). The remote appends commands to a web server using SSH.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Each <b>moses</b> zombie is operated indirectly through the use of a web server as an intermediary/proxy device</li>
<ul>
<li>This enforces a layer of anonymity by ensuring there's no direct connection with the target (victim) machine.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</p>
