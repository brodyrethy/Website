			<p>
				A mostly under-appreciated and unknown electronic album (to North Americans) of 2000s.
				A cool mix of break beats, orchestral compositions, french hip-hop, and club/trance/dance music encompassed into twelve progressive, inventive, and lengthy tracks (averaging approx. 6-7 minutes each).

			<p>
				I first discovered this album somewhere around 2016, and I still loop it to this day.
				Fantastic album.
