<h1>About This Website</h1>

<hr>

<p><a href="https://rethy.xyz">https://rethy.xyz</a> is about creating <b>useful</b> content. While most articles are computer related, I also share other things related to learning. Some of these include: <a href="visual_media.html">Visual Media</a>, <a href="music.html">Music</a>, <a href="literature.html">Literature</a>, and likely more whenever I feel like it.</p>

<p>I prefer to keep the website in web 1.0 style to keep the focus on the content, not the <i>"pretty design"</i>.</p>

<p><b>All content is free from frills and ulterior motives.</b></p>
