<h1>About This Website</h1> <hr>

<p><a href="https://rethy.xyz">https://rethy.xyz</a> is about creating <b>useful</b> content. Most is computer related, but I also share other things related to learning, like <a href="visual_media.html">Visual Media</a>, <a href="music.html">Music</a>, <a href="literature.html">Literature</a>, and likely more whenever I feel like it.</p>

<p>I trim the fat that is the majority of modern day content, keeping only the important.</p>

<p>You'll notice that I ameliorate articles on a daily basis to increase specificity. This is because modern day writers, especially academic, put an emphasis on difficulty and wankery instead of understanding and education, completely ostracizing those <i>not-in-the-know</i>.</p>

<p>I prefer to keep the website in web 1.0 style to keep focus on content, not <i>"pretty design"</i>.</p><br>

<p><b>All content is free from frills and ulterior motives.</b></p>
