<h1>Why Ricing Isn't a Waste of Time</h1>
<p><b><small>Created: 2021-02-10 | Modified: 2021-02-11</small></b></p><hr>

<p><b>Ricing</b>: A pejorative with origins in 90s car culture meaning someone who overly customizes a shitty car. Historically, the cars were limited to Asian cars, hence <i>rice</i> in <i>ricer</i>.</p>

<p>Ricing, in a computer sense, is in reference to heavily customizing a computer software's look and theme (usually on a Unix-based operating system). When used in this sense it's more positive, not meaning over-customization, or useless customization.</p>

<p>My argument, is to combat speech used against ricing; Those who claim it's a waste of time.</p>

<p>Ricing allows you to understand the inter-workings of the very software that you use on a daily basis. You start to discover each corner and crevice it has for the first time, which creates a sort of healthy ambition. This is the start. It's the budding process, the birth, of someone who enjoys computers. At least, it is for some people. For me it was fixing Malware ridden Dell trash-tops during the Windows XP era previously owned by a few family members before finally getting 'round to me.</p>

<p>The point is, ricing is not a waste of time, you're spending quality time learning an operating system, a program, or whatever it may be. It's probably one of the least useless past times you can have, you're actually learning when you do it.</p>

<p>If you play video games, don't make a fool of yourself by dismissing ricing as a <i>"waste of time"</i>.</p> <hr>
