		</p>
		<p>
			<b>A quick explanation</b>: A "gaming" VPN will only be useful if your network traffic is already being blocked/filtered inside of your LAN.
			In this case, the "gaming" VPN will allow you to encrypt your network traffic and in turn bypass any form of packet blocking/filtering taking place on your network. 
			In this case, it would allow you to run at the fully uncapped potential of the network.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>The problem</b>: Very rarely will any home networks contain packet blocking/filtering (if it does, you'd probably already know as you would have set it up yourself), but it's typical for company/university networks to.
			Even if this is the case, the speed will be totally dependent on the weakest link of the network.
			If your data is passing through a slow router/switch, all of your data will be bottleneck'd to the capacity of that device.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>TLDR</b>: "Gaming" VPNs won't do anything on your home network, unless your network traffic is being filtered (it probably isn't). If so, just buy a normal, uncapped (not gaming oriented) VPN, as they're cheaper.
