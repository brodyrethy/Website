            <h1>Why Gaming VPNs Are Scams</h1>
		<p>
			<b>DO NOT FALL FOR THESE GARBAGE SCAM/USELESS PROGRAMS</b>
		</p>
		<p>
			A quick explanation: A "gaming" VPN will be usefull only if your packets are being blocked/filtered inside of your network.
			In this case, the "gaming" VPN will allow you to encrypt your network traffic and in turn bypass any form of packet blocking/filtering taking place on your network. 
			In this case, it would allow you to run at the fully uncapped potential of the network.
			The problem: Very rarely will any home networks contain packet blocking/filtering (if it does, you'd probably already know as you would have set it up yourself), but it's typical for company/university networks to.
			Even if this is the case, the speed will be totally dependent on the weakest link of the network.
			If you have a slow router/switch, all of your data will be bottleneck'd to the capacity of that device.
		</p>
		<p>
			TLDR: "Gaming" VPNs won't do anything on your home network. If you're being packet filtered, just buy a normal, uncapped (not gaming oriented) VPN.
