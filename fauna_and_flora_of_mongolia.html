<p>Mongolia, home of the Mongols, has one of the most unique climactic conditions in the world. It holds over 3090 unique habitats dictated by its diverse conditions, cold and warm. The variance of wildlife species is truely amazing. It is understandable though, seeing as it's really a massive chunk of land ranging from the Caucus region, the cold Russian borders, all the way to China. A region steeped in a long and grueling history of war, afluency, and most recently: poverty.</p>

<h2>Temperate Occurrences</h2>
<h3>Zud (Dzud)</h3>
This is a mongolian term used to define a severe winter, typically one that kills a large amount of lifestock. Usually through starvation, the zud causes an inability to graze due to frostbitten vegetation.
