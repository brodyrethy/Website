<p>Updated <a href="../computing/my_windows_10_setup.html">My Windows 10 Setup</a> page to reflect my current setup.</p>

<p>I'm also working on a data forwarding system to work with <a href="../programming/moses_rat.html">moses.rat</a>. I want it to run as a service on a server, which will forward the information sent from the remote controller onto the next server with the service, which will send it onto the next, and so on. This'll create a sort of proxy system so you don't have to directly connect with the CnC. It's not yet complete, but you can find it on my <a href="https://github.com/rethyxyz/">GitHub</a> under the repository <a href="https://github.com/rethyxyz/command_chain">command_chain</a>.</p>

<p>Don't forget, it's for research purposes only.</p>

<p>Beside that, I need to update the moses.rat page to include some infographs of it in action.</p><br>

<p><b>TODO</b>: Update moses.rat page to include infographics of the thing in action (screenshot of desktops, and remote command execution)</p>

<p>I'm finally pushing somewhat of a final theme for this website. I ended up opting for straight lines rather than round ones for the boxes and such.</p> <br>

<p><del><b>TODO</b>: Add koss_headphones page to music and hardware index</del></p>
<p><del><b>TODO</b>: Add windows software page to windows index</del></p>
<p><b>TODO</b>: Add images to literature and visual media pages</p>

<p>I'm currently overtaking a big overhaul of my website. It's going to be much improved, and will be made to support more content than just articles. As shown by this page, I'll also have a sort of updates page showing what I'm doing, or for my future self to eventually do. The latter will be in the form of TODOs. You will see those eventually.</p>
