<h1>My Life in 2021</h1>
<p>This page essentially serves as a change log and a way to display what I'm doing.</p>

    <p>Added <a href="..\programming\taking_notes_in_html.html">Taking Notes in html</a> page. It's something I started doing recently, and have been enjoying it a lot. It's also nice being able to insert images into my note pages for once, as I had been using vim-wiki prior and for a long time.</p>
</section>



<section>
<small>2021-02-18 at 8:23 PM</small>
<p>Added <a href="../visual_media/apetor.html">Apetor</a>, <a href="../visual_media/amelie.html">Amelie</a>, and <a href="../visual_media/andrew_wood_documentary.html">Andrew Wood</a> pages to <a href="../visual_media/index.html">visual media</a> area.</p>
<p>Lots more content coming soon. I'm currently working on:</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>TODO</b> The Oxford comma</li>
<li><b>TODO</b> Pig Latin 101</li>
<li><b>TODO</b> File organizational guidelines</li>
<li><b>TODO</b> About Mongolia</li>
    <ul>
    <li><b>TODO</b> Lake Baikal</li>
    </ul>
<li><b>TODO</b> Debloating Windows 10</li>
<li><b>TODO</b> CRT monitor in 2021 as main device</li>
<li><b>TODO</b> RMS's (Richard Stallman) weird ass website</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Simplified <a href="../computing/an_efficient_vim.html">An Efficient <code>vim</code></a> page. I removed most of the text talking about each index, it's redundant. Each one, except for the first, is added to your <code>.vimrc</code>, which is obvious, so I don't need to write it each time.</p>

<p>Some things I need to research and learn:
<ul>
<li><b>TODO</b> Human genetics: DNA/Haplogroups</li>
<li><b>TODO</b> Go programming</li>
<li><b>TODO</b> The history of Europe (doing hallstatt culture a - d right now)</li>
	<ul>
	<li><b>TODO</b> Gauls</li>
	<li><b>TODO</b> The formation of Latin</li>
	</ul>
</ul>
</p>

<p>I'm currently writing a comprehensive guide of Hallstatt culture A - D (late Bronze Age to early Iron Age). Eventually I'll create an entire guide to Central Europe, going from start of Bronze Age all the way to the Roman Period.</p>

<p>I have another on the go about Great Apes. It's a compendium of every <a href="..\literature\term_definitions.html">extant</a> Great Ape. Upon completion, I may convert it to HTML or embed the PDF into this website (it's being written in LaTeX).</p>

<p>Some reminders so I don't forget about completing them:
<ul>
<li><b>TODO</b> Great Apes paper</li>
<li><b>TODO</b> LaTeX basics; How to get started writing LaTeX</li>
</ul>
</p>
</section>

<p>Updated <a href="../computing/my_windows_10_setup.html">My Windows 10 Setup</a> page to reflect my current setup.</p>
<p>I'm also working on a data forwarding system to work with <a href="../programming/moses_rat.html">moses.rat</a>. I want it to run as a service on a server, which will forward the information sent from the remote controller onto the next server with the service, which will send it onto the next, and so on. This'll create a sort of proxy system so you don't have to directly connect with the CnC. It's not yet complete, but you can find it on my <a href="https://github.com/rethyxyz/">GitHub</a> under the repository <a href="https://github.com/rethyxyz/command_chain">command_chain</a>.</p>
<p>Don't forget, it's for research purposes only.</p>
<p>Beside that, I need to update the moses.rat page to include some infographs of it in action.</p><br>
<p><b>TODO</b> Update moses.rat page to include infographics of the thing in action (screenshot of desktops, and remote command execution)</p>

<small>2021-02-09 at 12:31 AM (exact same time as last lol)</small>

<p>I'm finally pushing somewhat of a final theme for this website. I ended up opting for straight lines rather than round ones for the boxes and such.</p> <br>
<p><del><b>TODO</b> Add koss_headphones page to music and hardware index</del></p>
<p><del><b>TODO</b> Add windows software page to windows index</del></p>
<p><del><b>TODO</b> Add images to literature and visual media pages</del></p>

<p><center><img src="files/working_on_website_2021_02_08.png" /></center></p>
<p>I'm currently overtaking a big overhaul of my website. It's going to be much improved, and will be made to support more content than just articles. As shown by this page, I'll also have a sort of updates page showing what I'm doing, or for my future self to eventually do. The latter will be in the form of TODOs. You will see those eventually.</p>
