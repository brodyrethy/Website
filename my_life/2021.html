<p>I'm finally pushing somewhat of a final theme for this website. I ended up opting for straight lines rather than round ones for the boxes and such.</p> <br>

<p>I'm currently overtaking a big overhaul of my website. It's going to be much improved, and will be made to support more content than just articles. As shown by this page, I'll also have a sort of updates page showing what I'm doing, or for my future self to eventually do. The latter will be in the form of TODOs. You will see those eventually.</p>
