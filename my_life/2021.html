<p>I'm currently overtaking a big overhaul of my website. It's going to be much improved, and will be made to support more content than just articles. As shown by this page, I'll also have a sort of updates page showing what I'm doing, or for my future self to eventually do. The latter will be in the form of TODOs. You will see those eventually.</p>
