			<h1>Why Window Managers Produce the Fastest Workflow</h1>
			<h2>What is a Window Manager?</h2>
			<p>First, a definition of a window manager. A window manager is simply a piece of software which controls the placement of individual windows.</p>
            <br>

            <h2>What is a Floating Window Manager?</h2>
            <p>In a floating window manager, each window floats. <i>Typically</i>, a floating window manager is the default type you will see on Mac OS X, Windows, and Linux (GNOME, XFCE, Openbox, etc.).</p>
            <br>

			<h2>What is a Tiling Window Manager?</h2>
			<p>A tiling window manager is similar to the last definition but that it functions in a grid style instead of a floating one, where everything is displayed on the screen at once. More so, each window is either a master, or a slave. First, you open the master. When another window is opened, the master is divided where the new window is the master and the last is the slave. Then, when another is opened, the newest is the master, and the last two are slaves, and so on, so forth...</p>

                <br>
                i3wm: a <i>manual</i> tiling window manager (you choose how new windows are split, be it vertical or horizontally, and windows can be re-sized).
            </p>
            <br>

                <br>
                <br>
                dwm: a <i>dynamic</i> tiling window manager (Windows are split automatically; Master window on the left, slave windows on the left in "default" layout).
            </p>
            <br>

			<h2>The Speed Differences</h2>
            <p>Speed differences were obtained by comparing the number of key presses to accomplish various actions using each window manager. To simplify the testing process, I chose to compare just Windows 10 versus dwm and i3wm. i3wm and dwm were chosen because they are both two different sub-types of tiling window managers, being manual and dynamic.</p>
            <p><font_red>NOTE</font_red>: I chose to count a keyboard "chord" not as one entity, but instead the sum of keys being pressed. I made note of when a keyboard chord is used.</p>
            <br>

            <h3>Executing a Program</h3>
            <h4>Floating</h4>
            <h5>Shortcut</h5>
            <p>If shortcut is found on desktop, a double mouse click (equal to one key press each) achieves program execution.</p>
            <big>Total Number of Key Presses: 2</big>
            <br>
            <br>

            <h5>Pinned Taskbar Item</h5>
            <p>If shortcut is pinned as a taskbar item, the key chord <big>WindowsKey+1/2/3/4/5/6/...</big> (depending on the item) </p>
            <big>Total Number of Key Presses: 2</big>
            <br>
