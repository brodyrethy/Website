<h1>Koss Headphones: The Only Headphones You'll Ever Need</h1>
<p><font_red>Note</font_red>: I say <b>need</b>. I don't mean that all other headphones are bad, it's just that you only need Koss headphones. Please, don't flame me.</p><br>

<p>Koss headphones are the best headphones money can buy concerning price and performance. I'm not the only one who agrees. Most audiophiles agree that Koss headphones, esspecially the Porta Pro and KSC75, are the best entry-level audiophile headphones money can buy. Some prefer the KSC75 for it's wide soundstage and detailed high-end, others the Porta Pro for its dynamic range and well-rounded sound quality.</p><br>

<h2>Monetarily Cheap</h2>
<p>
<ul>
<li>KSC75: $26.00 dollars (CAD). Personally, these sound the best.</li>
<li>Porta Pro: $76.00 dollars (CAD).</li>
</ul>
Koss also has a (limited) lifetime warranty. If you break them, send them to Koss and they'll repair them for free (just pay $10.00 CAD shipping). I've owned my Porta Pro for 4 years and they still work great. I've owned the KSC75 for almost 2 years, and my UR40 for 2 months, and they still work great. So far, no degradation whatsoever.
</p><br>

<h2>Huge Selection</h2>
<p>Porta Pros, KSC75s, UR40s, and KPH30i. These are just a few of their affordable headphones, which, for the most part, are completely unknown to the general consumer and anyone not in the know.

Not the most stylish. Koss headphones are function over form.

<h2>Audiophile Grade</h2>
<p>As I said in the first section, the headphones I mentioned are audiophile grade. If you don't trust me, take it from these professional headphone reviewers:<br><br>

<h1>My Personal Recommendation</h1>
Buy the KSCi5. I own the UR40s, Porta Pros, and the KSC75s. The KSC75s have the best sound by far. The crazy part is that they're only $26.00 dollars (CAD), which is half of the price of the UR40s, and a third of the price of Porta Pros. Once you try them, you won't think about buying any other headphones than these ones.
